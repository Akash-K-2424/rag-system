# Sample Data

This directory contains sample PDF documents for testing the RAG system.

## Adding Sample PDFs

1. Place your PDF files in this directory
2. Upload them through the web interface
3. Ask questions about the content

## Recommended Test Documents

For testing the RAG system with AI/ML content:

1. **Research Papers**
   - Attention Is All You Need (Transformer paper)
   - BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers
   - GPT-3: Language Models are Few-Shot Learners

2. **Technical Documentation**
   - PyTorch tutorials
   - TensorFlow guides
   - Hugging Face documentation

3. **Academic Articles**
   - Machine Learning fundamentals
   - Deep Learning architectures
   - Natural Language Processing

## File Format

- Only PDF files are supported
- Maximum file size: 50MB (configurable)
- Recommended: 10-100 pages per document

## Testing

After uploading a document, try these types of questions:

- **Factual:** "What is the main topic?"
- **Specific:** "What datasets were used?"
- **Comparative:** "How does this compare to X?"
- **Technical:** "Explain the methodology"
- **Summary:** "What are the key findings?"

## Notes

- The system works best with well-structured documents
- PDFs with images may have reduced text extraction
- Scanned PDFs (images) won't work - use OCR first
